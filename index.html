        <p>
             I just graduated from a French engineering school called INSA Lyon as an Electrical Engineer,
             specialized in Microelectronics. I was an apprentice during my 3 years at INSA, in the railway company
             Alstom where I worked as an industrial test engineer. Recently, I did a 6-month internship at
             ASML in the Netherlands, where I took on the role of electrical and firmware engineer.
